When you are traveling, you can look at multiple cities and plan your trip accordingly


```
You can search for a city and it will display the current weather condition:

Temperature
Humidity
Wind Speed
UV Index

You will also have a 5 day forecast with the date and icon representing the weather condition, temperature and humidity.

And your previous search history will show on the left.

You will be presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

Happy Traveling!
